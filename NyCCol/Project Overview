The New York Police Department (NYPD) collects details about motor vehicle accidents and provides publicly available de-identified data via the NYC Open Data website for collisions with personal injuries and fatalities or involving at least $1,000 worth of damage (which requires police report, MV104-AN). A number of data analysts have publicly reported on this dataset, including this student blog, which is replicated and illustrated using current data in the dashboard.
